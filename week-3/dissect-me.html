      <h3>For this first entry into my technical blog series, I'm going to look at 3 questions related to the application git. The questions are:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>What are the benefits of version control?</li>
          <li>How does git help you keep track of changes?</li>
          <li>Why use GitHub to store your code?</li>
        </ol>
    <p>
        So the first question is about the benefits of version control, but let's define what version control is first. Version control is a method of keeping multiple versions of a program or system organized and easily accessible for yourself and other developers. Version control creates save states of the code whenever someone enacts a change. This can be tremendously helpful when coding for several reasons. First, it gives you a backup point that you can always flip to if something goes horribly awry. Let's say you add a feature to a website you're working on. Everything seems fine, so you apply the changes and go on your way. Unfortunately, the next day you find that the feature <i>actually</i> crashes the whole website and no one has been able to access it for the past 10 hours. With version control, you can just change your code back to its previously functioning state without needing to go through and undo all the changes you just made. Second, version control allows you to keep track of changes made to the code. If you need to go review a change you made several months ago, you can always find it since changes are listed and dated. Last, version control is very beneficial for teams of coders working on the same project. Imagine there two editors going through a book manuscript and making edits separately. How could they implement their respective changes without coming into conflict? Even if they're working on separate parts of the manuscript (say, one is editing the first half, the other the second half), they will inevitably run into issues. For example, if the second editor decides that a character's name should be spelled differently, the change must be applied across the whole book, not just his half. The same issue applies to two coders trying to work on the same project. Fortunately, version control allows for the code to be updated in very nearly real time, so you can make sure you're not deleting or overwriting a change someone else just made when you add your own updates.

        This leads nicely into git. Git is a version control system that allows programmers to easily make and save changes to their code. Git is fairly simple to learn, but more importantly, it's fast, efficient and effective. Git helps you keep track of changes by creating versions, or "commits", of your code whenever you ask it to. These commits are stored locally on your computer, and you can access them at any point. Additionally, it's common practice to write a short message detailing changes made every time you make a commit. These messages are very important when going back through the list of commits to see what was changed. A simple date will mean very little to you when trying to figure out what you changed, and nothing to another person who might happen to be reviewing your code. Git packages up all these features making it an excellent version control tool.
    </p>

        That leaves us lastly with GitHub. GitHub is similar to git, but with a few key differences. While files in git are stored locally on your own computer, files on GitHub are stored remotely on the GitHub servers. Anything stored with GitHub is publicly accessible, meaning someone looking at your profile would be able to view and download any files you've uploaded. While this might sounds a bit daunting, there are some real benefits to storing your code in the public domain. First, since anyone can access it, anyone can add their own changes to the code. This could lead to a collaborative effort where multiple parties work on fixing and improving a base code. Also, having your code up on GitHub means you can access it on any computer at any time (provided you have internet). This could be useful for working on a code from multiple computers. Finally, GitHub is a good place to show off what you've accomplished. When job hunting, your GitHub profile is like a portfolio showing off not just the end product, but the reasoning and coding skills it took to get there.

<!-- GPS 1.2 Reflection
-What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
    I seem to always find myself returning to the <section> tag. It seems really helpful for dividing up the main contents of a page when other tags are too specific to apply. I didn't use them today, but I also think <article>, <nav>, and <footer> are really helpful tags because they apply to very specific sections of the page.

-How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
    Elements are layed out on a page in sections. The browser starts with the first element inside of the <body> section of the page. It then checks that section of nested elements, and reads those next. Even if you tag a later element as a higher rank heading than one before it, it will still read the element which appears first in the document before the other. That is, let's say you have
      <body>
        <h3>Hi,</h3>
        <h1>what's up?</h1>
      </body>
    as your body for whatever reason. The browser will still read <h3>Hi</h3> first, even though <h1>what's up?</h1> is a higher rank. Essentially, the browser reads the page from top to bottom no matter what.

-What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
    Learning about snippets was really cool. It's starting to become clear how useful of a code editor Sublime is. I know I'll be creating more shortcuts in the future. Probably, I'll make a shortcut for the skeleton of my blog pages soon so I can easily format them all the same. I'll also look more into existing shortcuts. I imagine there must be a quick skeleton for other coding languages.
