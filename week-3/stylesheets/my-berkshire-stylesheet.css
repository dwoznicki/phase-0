-What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

  There are two things you must know. First, you should know where the stylesheet is in relation to the HTML file. Generally, it's good make a new stylesheets directory inside the directory of the HTML file to keep things simple. Second, you must know the name of the CSS file. If not, you can't link
  it.
-What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

  One of the tricks we used was a handy attribute called vertical-align. That helped us get the list to align from the top of the section. We also worked a lot with margins to get the spacing right. It was a bit tricky to get positioning just right in places. The original site is designed as a table, which meant we had to emulate table spacing without making a table ourselves.

-What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

  We used a number of common attributes including color, background-color, font-size, and font-weight. Additionally, we modified visted links to be red using the line
    a:visited {
      color:#ff0000;
    }

-Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

  We did modify the HTML to include classes and ids. We generally used classes when they applied to multiple elements, such as the capital letters in Berkshire Hathaway, which had to be bigger than the rest. For elements that needed to be styled alone, we used ids. If there was a large section, such as the list or the header, we styled it using the HTML tags <ul> and <header>.

-When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

  I think our newer version was certainly cleaner and followed better practices. As my partner pointed out, the original Berkshire Hathaway site is from an earlier time. It's formatted as a table, an uncommon style these days. There is not CSS stylesheet, so all the styles are written right into the HTML. I think newer versions are cleaner and easier to read for developers. Our site would also be more compatible with screen readers, though the original site did well when changing the window size.
