<!--
	-What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
		For me, it was cool to actually write a full page in HTML. I'd practiced on CodeAcademy a bit in the past, but this was the first time I'd done it from scratch.
		It was good review on the fundamentals.
	- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
		It was pretty straightforward. CodeAcademy provided most of the training required for the tags. For the registered trademark, we just did a google search and found a page that listed all the different characters and symbols that you could use.
	- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)?
		We did just fine without any styling or formatting. We just need to add some styling in a CSS page to make it more like the original.
	- What seems good and bad about HTML?
		HTML is important because it's the skeleton of every web page. It's also fairly easy to learn. So there's a lot of extra typing because of angle brackets.
	- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
		When you open a tag, close it right away so you don't forget. If you indent, it makes the code easier to read. If you write the name of a tag and press TAB, it'll automatically create an opening and closing tag in Sublime.
