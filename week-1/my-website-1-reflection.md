In order to create a repository, you'll need a GitHub account. On the home page, you'll see a green button called '+New repository'. Click it. Give the repository a name and a license from the drop-down menu below and click 'Create repository'. You now have a new repository. to clone your repository, you'll need to copy the URL on the right hand side of the screen. It should start https://github.com/. Go into your command line and find the directory where you want to store your new repository. Type the command 'git clone URL', and your computer will download a copy of the repository.

Open source is a modern style of coding that allows other developers to view, copy, edit, and distribute your code. It's a kind of licensing designed for collaborative programming, where multiple people can work on or add to a project.

I think Open Source is very useful. I could see how it would be extremely beneficial to allow others to make changes to your code. If you're stuck on a bug and need help, or if someone else wants to add some cool new features, it can all be done without hassle. So it doesn't make me feel nervous or protective. But I also wouldn't call it "utopia". It just seems like a useful, efficient, and modern method for coding.

Licenses are important for a couple of reasons. First, they prevent others from simply copying a code and selling it for profit. People could try to do so, but they'd have to include a copy of the license showing that the code was available for free elsewhere. Second, some licenses protect the code as your intellectual property, meaning that others are allowed to use or edit it, but they have to give credit to you as the creator.

This challenge helped me understand how html code is made into an actual front-end product. We did something very simple, but theoretically wd could have designed a whole series of pages and formatting in the sublime editor. I didn't have any "aha!" moments for this one, unfortunately. It was cool to see my html web page, though. I struggled a bit recalling the git commands to push and pull the code, so I had to review.

I didn't find any resources, per se, but I did find the command for deleting a branch in command line, which I don't think I'd seen yet. It's 'git branch -d branchname'.
